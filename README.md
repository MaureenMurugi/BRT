# Description
>  Our system introduces a bus system where one can access the bus routes, with standardized bus fares and different peak points from the comfort of  your home on your device.  Users can easily see the available buses, the prices, and the specific routes to the CBD.
 This will allow users not to waste time in bus stages waiting for the bus, because they are sure of the bus they will board and the exact time and the bus fare, to and from the Thika superhighway to town.
